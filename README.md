# solarEUV
Contains the NEUVAC empirical model of solar EUV irradiance for use primarily in thermosphere-ionosphere models, developed primarily by Dr. Aaron J. Ridley, with analysis and minor contributions from Dr. Daniel A. Brandt.

This repository also contains code for compariing and analyzing the performance of NEUVAC in comparison to other empirical models such as EUVAC, FISM, and HEUVAC.
